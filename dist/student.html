                              an unfair advantage to others may violate AAP's <a href="https://homewoodgrad.jhu.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/35/2018/08/Homewood-WSE_KSAS_-WSE-EP_KSAS-AAP-Graduate-Academic-Misconduct-Policy-2018SU.pdf">Code of Conduct</a> and the University's <a href="http://studentaffairs.jhu.edu/policies/student-code/">Student Conduct Code</a>.

                            <h5>Confidentiality and Mandatory Reporting</h5>
                            <p>As an instructor, one of my responsibilities is to help create a safe and inclusive learning environment on our campus. I also have mandatory reporting responsibilities related to my role as a Responsible Employee under the Sexual Misconduct Policy & Procedures (which prohibits sexual harassment, sexual assault, relationship violence and stalking), as well as the General Anti-Harassment Policy (which prohibits all types of protected status based discrimination and harassment). It is my goal that you feel able to share information related to your life experiences in classroom discussions, in your written work, and in our one-on-one meetings. I will seek to keep information you share private to the greatest extent possible. However, I am required to share information that I learn of regarding sexual misconduct, as well as protected status based harassment and discrimination, with the Office of Institutional Equity (OIE). For a list of individuals/offices who can speak with you confidentially, please see Appendix B of the <a href="https://sexualassault.jhu.edu/policies-laws">JHU Sexual Misconduct Policies and Laws</a>.</p>
                            <p>For more information on both policies mentioned above, please see: <a href="https://oie.jhu.edu/policies-and-laws/jhu-policies/index.html">JHU Relevant Policies, Codes, Statements and Principles</a>. Please also note that certain faculty and other University community members also have a duty as a designated Campus Safety Authority under the Clery Act to notify campus security of certain crimes, as well as a duty under State law and University policy to report suspected child abuse and/or neglect.</p>
                            <h5>Attendance/Participation</h5>
                            <p>Participation in lectures, discussions, and other activities is an essential part of the instructional process. Students are expected to attend class regularly. Students who expect to miss a class should inform their instructor ahead of time. <span class="text-primary">(Modify to fit your school's need)</span></p>
                            <p><em>If instructors wish to specify their own course-specific attendance/ participation policy, they should clearly detail the specific expectations regarding student attendance/participation, including (but not limited to) the following:</em></p>
                            <ul>
                              <li>"Definition of an "authorized" vs. "unauthorized" absence from class.</li>
                              <li>"Details of the penalty (if any) for an "unauthorized" absence from class.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p><em>Please note that if an instructor wishes to employ an attendance/participation policy in which students are penalized for unauthorized absences-for example, through the deduction of points awarded for class participation or a reduction in a letter grade-the specific consequences for missing a class (or classes) must be clearly communicated to the students.</em></p>
                            <h5>Diversity</h5>
                            <p>The Johns Hopkins <span class="text-primary">Name of School</span> defines diversity as follows:</p>
                            <p class="text-primary">Put your diversity statement here.</p>
                            <h5>Student Conduct Code</h5>
                            <p>The fundamental purpose of the Johns Hopkins University's (the "University" or "JHU") regulation of student conduct is to promote and to protect the health, safety, welfare, property, and rights of all members of the University community as well as to promote the orderly operation of the University and to safeguard its property and facilities. As members of the University community, students accept certain responsibilities which support the educational mission and create an environment in which all students are afforded the same opportunity to succeed academically.</p>
                            <p>For a full description of the code please visit the following Website:<a href="https://studentaffairs.jhu.edu/policies-guidelines/student-code/">https://studentaffairs.jhu.edu/policies-guidelines/student-code/</a></p>
                            <h5>Course Evaluation</h5>
                            <p><span class="text-primary">(modify as needed)</span> Please remember to complete an online course evaluation survey for this course. These evaluations are an important tool in the ongoing efforts to improve instructional quality and strengthen programs. The results of the course evaluations are kept anonymous - your instructor will only receive aggregated data and comments for the entire class. An email with a link to the online course evaluation form will be sent to your JHU email address close to the end of the semester. (Please note that if a course has fewer than three enrolled students, we will not conduct an online course evaluation survey for the course.)</p>
